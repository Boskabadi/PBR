Toward Sustainable Development of Biomanufacturing: A Soft Sensor for Real-Time Monitoring of Sequencing Photobioreactors

# Overview
Welcome to the PBR repisority. This repisority has been designed for development of soft sensor for photobioreactor. experimental data results and codes for different machin learning algorithms are available in this reposority

# Files 
1- **Datasets**
Run1.Xlsx includes the data of the first experiment
Run2.Xlsx includes the data of the second experiment
Run3.Xlsx includes the data of the third experiment

2- **Python Scripts**
PBR.ipynb includes all codes for predecting dissolved oxygen as quality indicator variable
PBROD.ipynb includes all codes for predicting optical density as quality indicator variables
